marginal present time clearcut symptom critical limb ischemia though slight discoloration toe clear sign previous history graft include prior thrombosis require thrombectomy multiple revision would board well attempt thrombolysis repeat rescue particular conduit conversely already low extremity vein used bypass operation redo bypass would technically complicate need review previous angiogram earlier year determine status runoff alternative might present time however appear marginal though reasonable collateralization essentially asymptomatic think would reasonable increase antithrombotic therapy add daily dose plavix supplement baby aspirin spent sometime discuss sign worsen ischemia include diffuse cyanotic skin change toe rest pain ulceration minimum see back two month reexamination
