lauren ferrara came office today followup visit know long complex history peripheral vascular disease bilateral lower extremity bypass grafts left lower extremity bypass graft occluded previously successfully restored dr tejeda 0261 detected highgrade stenosis distal aspect graft surveillance underwent revision local patch angioplasty subsequent ultrasound study done 0461 showed widely patent graft remained entirely asymptomatic particularly active denies rest pain feet significant claudication symptoms recently however husband noticed cyanosis left toes remains low dose aspirin addition lipitor medications nonsmoker examination today appeared well good spirits blood pressure measured 13060 right arm lower extremity pulses 2 femoral level bilaterally right strong easily appreciated

impending ulcerations areas irreversible ischemia strong doppler signal obtained posterior tibial artery ankle occlusion pressure approximately 100 mmhg yields ankle index nearly 07 maybe falsely elevated followup ultrasound study performed vascular laboratory today right lower extremity bypass remains widely patent suspected left lower extremity bypass demonstrated occluded ms ferrara left lower extremity bypass graft occluded sometime last several months collateralization clearly marginal present time clearcut symptoms critical limb ischemia though slight discoloration toes clear sign previous history graft including prior thrombosis requiring thrombectomy multiple revisions would board well attempted thrombolysis repeated rescue particular conduit conversely already lower extremity veins used bypass operations redo bypass would technically complicated need review previous angiograms earlier year determine status runoff alternatives might present time however appears marginal though reasonable collateralization essentially asymptomatic think would reasonable increase antithrombotic therapy added daily dose plavix supplement baby aspirin spent sometime discussing signs worsening ischemia including diffuse cyanotic skin changes toes rest pain ulceration minimum see back two months reexamination strongly encouraged patient husband contact us soon symptoms suggest worsening circulation collateralization remain stable certainly would preferable avoid consider complex redo bypass limited remaining vein patient thank allowing us participate care please
