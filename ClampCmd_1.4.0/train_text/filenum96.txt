catheterizations 2060s failed document significant coronary artery disease done evaluation chest pain angiogram july 2071 showed moderate circumflex coronary artery disease managed medically however suffered nonq wave myocardial infarction february 2072 time underwent cardiac catheterization showing progressive coronary artery disease therefore underwent multivessel coronary bypass graft operation including left internal mammary artery lad reverse saphenous vein grafts pda d1 obtuse marginal branch underwent repeat catheterization february 2073 comfrey clinic showed diffuse native disease apparently significant bypass graft pathology underwent repeat cardiac catheterization may 2074 current angina time evidence 60 proximal lad stenosis proximal severe circumflex artery stenosis
